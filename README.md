# Professional-Portfolio

Challenge #2 for Module #2
The challenge required for us to create a professional portfolio.
In this challenge the following had to be done:
-Shows all espect of the portfolio
-Provides a nav bar, where it will scroll down to different sections based on what is clicked.
-The first project is bigger than the others.
-When you click on the projects it direct you to the link of the projects.
- When you resize the screen, the portfolio will adapt and adjust to its size.

(PROJECTS used here are not mines except the last one being the under construction project. Given that I have no existing projects, I just link them to existing websites/ projects).
